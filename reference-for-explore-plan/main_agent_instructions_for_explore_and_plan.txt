# Main Agent Instructions for Explore and Plan Subagents

## From Task Tool Description - Available Agent Types:

- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. "src/components/**/*.tsx"), search code for keywords (eg. "API endpoints"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. "how do API endpoints work?"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: "quick" for basic searches, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "very thorough" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)

- Plan: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. "src/components/**/*.tsx"), search code for keywords (eg. "API endpoints"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. "how do API endpoints work?"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: "quick" for basic searches, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "very thorough" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)

## From Tool Usage Policy:

- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.

### Examples:

<example>
user: Where are errors from the client handled?
assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]
</example>

<example>
user: What is the codebase structure?
assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]
</example>
